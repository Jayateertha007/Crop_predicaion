🌾 Crop Recommendation App (Built with Streamlit)
The Crop Recommendation App is an intelligent web-based tool that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. It features a secure login/signup system, interactive UI, and real-time recommendations powered by a machine learning model.

🚀 Features
🌱 Crop Prediction: Recommends crops using a trained ML model based on user-input soil and weather conditions.

🔐 User Authentication: Includes login and signup pages to secure access to recommendations.

🧭 Simple Navigation: Sidebar with pages for Home, Login, Signup, and Recommendation.

📲 Session Management: Maintains user session and handles logout with clean UI flow.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python

ML Model: Trained classifier (e.g., RandomForest or similar)

Authentication: Custom session state logic using Streamlit’s state management
